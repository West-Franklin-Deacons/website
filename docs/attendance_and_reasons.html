                    The senior adult group consistently cites "preaching and biblical teaching" as their primary reason 
                    for choosing West Franklin. When asked what stands out, they frequently mention "friendliness" and 
                    "worship experience." Their long-term attendance pattern (57.2% attending 4+ years) suggests they 
                    find deep value in these core aspects of church life.

                    standout feature.

                    Recent growth in this age group (34.8% joining in last 1-3 years) appears driven by the church's 
                    strong biblical teaching and family ministry opportunities. They frequently cite "preaching style" 
                    and "opportunities for involvement" as standout features, suggesting they value both spiritual depth 
                    and active participation.

                    correlates with positive feedback about "welcoming atmosphere" and "family-focused activities" as
