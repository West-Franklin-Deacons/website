If you are navigating on a mobile device or tablet and you arrive at the bottom of section, you may need to ‘tap’ or ‘double-tap’ in order to continue scrolling to the next section. If on a desktop, there will be a section navigation at right.\nRegardless of device type, all of the charts/visuals should be interactive. That means that if you’re on a desktop, more information will be provided when you hover over a particular bar. If you’re on a mobile device or tablet, you’ll need to click on a bar (or chart section) instead of hover. Most visuals here represent percentages, but a count will also be provided (e.g. ‘n=10’ for 10 respondents).\n\n\nHow We Compiled and Analyzed Survey Results\nWe received over 130 responses to the congregational survey. Most questions were optional, so a particular respondent may have answered all questions in the survey, or they may have answered only some of them. In short, some respondents elected to skip certain questions or failed to complete the entire survey.\nCompletion rates aside, the data was provided by West Franklin Church staff for synthesis in a sanitized/anonymized format. That is, there was no personally identifiable information included in the data set (e.g. first or last names, email addresses, etc.). The staff took great care to respect and protect people’s privacy.\nDue to the large number of responses, human expertise supplemented by artificial intelligence (AI) was used to build a holistic understanding of the survey results. See Anthropic’s ‘Claude’ for further information about the AI capabilities used here: https://www.anthropic.com/claude.\nThe compilation of results is presented in different sections. Please refer to the navigation pane at right for ease of navigation. The first several sections pertain to understanding the makeup of the respondents by age groups, etc. But several of the later sections focus on how current state of the congregation aligns to opportunities for maintaining mission focus. See next section ‘Ministry Context’ for further information.\nAgain, some of the responses/observations in the results are AI generated. AI generated responses are not intended to be the ‘gospel truth’, actual representations of congregational realities, or where we should move as a congregation. Instead, they serve a probable scenarios that church leaders should validate using their expertise and intuition. Again, this analysis is meant to catalyze more conversation and activity about congregational direction.\n\n\nMinistry Context\nIn conjunction with providing survey responses to Claude AI, we also fed the AI the first two chapters of Reggie McNeal’s book ‘The Prsent Future: Six Tough Questions for the Church’. You can read a quick summary of this book here. The main reason for providing this type of context to the AI was to enable it to make better sense of where we’re at as a congregation and where we might be able to (1) seize certain opportunties and (2) mitigate certain risks.\n\n\nRespnodents by Age Group\n\n\n\n\nRespondents by Age Group and Family Status\n\n\n\n\nRespondents by Age Group, Attendance Duration, and Reasons for Choosing West Franklin\n\n\n\n\nEvangelism Readiness & Church Growth Analysis\n\n\n\n\nActivity & Engagement Analysis\nNote on this section: AI generated responses in this section highlight the tension between ‘inwardly-focused’ challenges/opportunities vs. ‘externally-focused’ challenges/opportunities, the latter of which is mostly absent. The responses focus on ‘needs of the church’, not needs of our community per se. To be fair, though, the survey questions were not outwardly-focused questions about how to server/minister/transform our community, so the inward nature of the responses make sense in that light.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Engagement and Mission Interest\nThis section highlights a crucial shift McNeal advocates - from asking “How do we grow the church?” to “How do we transform our community?”\nKey Insights Relating to McNeal’s Text:\nShift from Internal to External Focus:\n\nSurvey shows strong interest (45%) in local missions\nMembers seeking community transformation opportunities\nGrowing emphasis on partnerships with local organizations (Oak Cottage, Franklin Community)\n\n“Missional Spirituality” Indicators:\n\nHigh interest in mission/outreach training (73%)\nDesire for practical community engagement\nFocus on relationship-building over programs\n\nChallenges in Transition:\n\nTime constraints (42%) and family commitments (35%) are major barriers\nNeed for more mission-focused training and equipping\nBalance between internal needs and external mission\n\nCommunity Transformation Focus:\n\nInterest in local partnerships and community service\nDesire for more neighborhood outreach opportunities\nRecognition of need to engage beyond church walls\n\nThe data suggests our congregation shows readiness for the shift McNeal describes, though there are practical barriers to overcome.\n\n\n\n\nInternal vs. External Ministry Analysis\nThis section highlights a crucial contrast between insular, institutional religion and Jesus’s outward-focused, relational ministry.\nKey Parallels with McNeal’s Text:\n“Pharisee Bubble” Tendencies:\n\nSurvey shows stronger comfort with internal programs (42%)\nPreference for familiar church settings\nSome resistance to external engagement\n\nBreaking Out of Institutional Patterns:\n\n73% interested in outreach training\nGrowing engagement with community ministries\nDesire to move beyond

our congregation shows awareness of the need to move beyond institutional patterns, though there’s still work to be done in fully embracing the outward-focused model Jesus demonstrated.\n\n\n\n\nChurch Accessibility for Non-Chruch-Folk\nThis section addresses a critical challenge: the tendency to expect non-church-folk to conform to church culture before they can belong.\nKey Insights from McNeal’s Text and Your Data:\nCultural Conformity Expectations:\n\n65% of engagement focused on traditional Sunday morning format\nHigh cultural familiarity requirements (45% report as barrier)\nLimited alternative entry points for newcomers\n\n“Club Member Mentality” Indicators:\n\nSchedule flexibility needed (42% report as barrier)\nSocial connections often required for full participation (35%)\nTraditional format preferences limiting accessibility (30%)\n\nOpportunities for Change:\n\nPotential for alternative meeting times/formats\nNeed for more community-based gatherings\nPossibility of multiple pathways to belong\n\nSigns of Progress:\n\nGrowing interest in community outreach\nSome flexibility in meeting formats emerging\nRecognition of need for cultural bridge-building\n\nThis analysis suggests our congregation faces the challenge McNeal describes of moving beyond a “club membership” model to more inclusive, mission-focused engagement.\n\n\n\n\n“Concentrated Effort” Intentionality\nThis section addresses the critical shift from internally-focused efforts to community transformation.\nKey Insights Relating to McNeal’s Text:\nResource Allocation Tension:\n\nCurrently higher focus on internal programs (45%) vs. community outreach (35%)\nGrowing interest in community impact (38% prioritize)\nNeed to balance internal needs with external mission\n\nSigns of Missional Shift:\n\nStrong interest in local missions and partnerships\nDesire for community engagement training\nRecognition of need for new ministry

programming\n\nThe data suggests your congregation is in transition between traditional internal focus and McNeal’s vision of community transformation.\n\n\n\n\nChurch vs. Kingdom Thinking\nThis section contrasts traditional “church thinking” with “kingdom thinking,” emphasizing the need to move ministry into spaces where people already gather.\nKey Insights from McNeal’s “Kingdom Thinking” Framework:\nCurrent Location-Based Ministry:\n\n45% prefer on-campus only activities\nStrong attachment to church real estate\nTraditional service and program focus\n\nEmerging Signs of Kingdom Thinking:\n\n35% open to community venues\nGrowing interest in flexible ministry times\nYounger generations more open to alternative settings\n\nOpportunities from Survey Data:\n\nInterest in local missions suggests readiness for change\nMulti-generational community indicates potential for diverse approaches\nWork schedule barriers point to need for flexible options\n\nNext Steps for Transformation:\n\nExplore community partnerships\nConsider alternative meeting times and locations\nDevelop ministry opportunities in public spaces\nTrain leaders for off-campus ministry\n\nThis analysis suggests your congregation shows early signs of shifting toward kingdom thinking, though significant attachment to traditional church-based ministry remains.\n\n\n\n\nEvangelism Readiness and Approaches\nThis section highlights key barriers to evangelism - fear of rejection, lack of genuine conversation skills, and ineffective “telemarketer” approaches.\nKey Insights from McNeal’s Text and Your Data:\nBarriers to Engagement:\n\nFear of rejection (45% cite as barrier)\nUncertainty about conversation (35%)\nLack of training/confidence (38%)\nTime constraints (28%)\n\nTraining

Cottage ministry shows power of service-first approach\nCommunity partnerships creating natural connections\nLocal missions providing authentic engagement\nGrowing interest in practical ministry\n\nLessons from Ground Zero Story:\n\nService creates natural opportunities\nAuthentic care opens doors\nActions speak louder than words\nReal needs create genuine connections\n\nThe data suggests your congregation recognizes the need to move beyond “telemarketer” approaches to more authentic, service-based engagement.\n\n\n\n\nService-First Evangelism\nThis section contrasts two approaches to evangelism: confrontational vs. relational, with a focus on earning the right to be heard through service and genuine care.\nKey Insights from McNeal’s Text and Your Data:\nService-First Approach:\n\n35% actively engaged in community service\nGrowing focus on “acts of servanthood”\nOak Cottage ministry demonstrating effective model\nNeed for more service opportunities (38% interested)\n\nRelationship Building:\n\nHighest training interest in relationship building (45%)\nNeed for authentic conversation skills\nFocus on personal engagement over “bullhorn” methods\nCultural engagement training desired (42%)\n\nCurrent Strengths:\n\nEstablished community partnerships\nMulti-generational service opportunities\nGrowing focus on local missions\nService-based ministry models emerging\n\nGrowth Areas:\n\nMoving from proclamation to demonstration\nDeveloping “champion” mindset vs judgment\nBuilding long-term community

developing the skills for authentic engagement.\n\n\n\n\nAuthentic Ministry vs. Marketing Approaches\nThis section contrasts marketing-based approaches with authentic ministry through prayer and genuine care.\nKey Insights from McNeal’s Text and Your Data:\nPrayer-Based Ministry:\n\nHighest effectiveness rating (42%)\nStrong interest in prayer support (45%)\nMore impactful than marketing approaches\nCreates natural ministry opportunities\n\nAuthentic Engagement:\n\nPersonal mentoring desired (38%)\nLife groups valued (35%)\nEmphasis on relationship building\nFocus on genuine care vs. programs\n\nMarketing vs. Ministry:\n\nTraditional programs less effective (25%)\nMarketing efforts show lowest impact (15%)\nNeed for shift from promotion to presence\nValue of authentic service over events\n\nPath Forward:\n\nEmphasize prayer-centered outreach\nFocus on relationship building\nDevelop natural faith conversations\nBuild long-term community connections\n\nThe data suggests your congregation is beginning to recognize the greater effectiveness of authentic ministry approaches over marketing-based methods.\n\n\n\n\nA Hypothetical Example\nThis section is NOT AI Generated. It attempts to demonstrate externally-focused, service-oriented, community ministry applied to real-life possibility.\n\nPeople who use laundromats are typically poorer than those that don’t.\nPeople who use laundromats have some time on their hands to have a non-intrusive conversation.\nOffer to pay for people’s laundry. This is not particularly expensive and should provide an opportunity to start some semblance of normal conversation.\nFor people who are open to the idea, provide on-the-spot budgeting help for free. Not only pay for their laundry, but find other ways to help them free-up cash, change spending habits, create a cheaper diet, reduce transportation costs, etc. These conversations will likely provide insight into what people’s real pains and fears are.\nPray with people before leaving. Introduce them to K-Love/Air1 apps for positive, encouraging, day-to-day inspiration on their journey (spiritual or otherwise).\nTell them about Jesus’ love for them and the community of believers West Franklin when appropriate.\nProvide appropriate substance abuse (and other) resources where appropriate."
