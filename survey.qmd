## 2024 Congregational Survey Results

#### Navigation
This analysis is best viewed on a desktop PC, but it's also possible to view on a mobile device or tablet.  If you are navigating on a mobile device or tablet and you arrive at the bottom of section, you may need to 'tap' or 'double-tap' in order to continue scrolling to the next section.  If on a desktop, there will be a section navigation at right.

Regardless of device type, all of the charts/visuals should be interactive.  That means that if you're on a desktop, more information will be provided when you hover over a particular bar.  If you're on a mobile device or tablet, you'll need to click on a bar (or chart section) instead of hover.  Most visuals here represent percentages, but a count will also be provided (e.g. 'n=10' for 10 respondents).

#### How We Compiled and Analyzed Survey Results

We received over 130 responses to the congregational survey.  Most questions were optional, so a particular respondent may have answered all questions in the survey, or they may have answered only some of them.  In short, some respondents elected to skip certain questions or failed to complete the entire survey.

Completion rates aside, the data was provided by West Franklin Church staff for synthesis in a sanitized/anonymized format.  That is, there was no personally identifiable information included in the data set (e.g. first or last names, email addresses, etc.).  The staff took great care to respect and protect people's  privacy.

Due to the large number of responses, human expertise supplemented by artificial intelligence (AI) was used to build a holistic understanding of the survey results.  See Anthropic's 'Claude' for further information about the AI capabilities used here: [https://www.anthropic.com/claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude).

The compilation of results is presented in different sections.  Please refer to the navigation pane at right for ease of navigation.  The first several sections pertain to understanding the makeup of the respondents by age groups, etc.  But several of the later sections focus on how current state of the congregation aligns to opportunities for maintaining mission focus.  See next section 'Ministry Context' for further information.

Again, some of the responses/observations in the results are AI generated.  AI generated responses are not intended to be the 'gospel truth', actual representations of congregational realities, or where we should move as a congregation.  Instead, they serve a probable scenarios that church leaders should validate using their expertise and intuition.  Again, this analysis is meant to catalyze more conversation and activity about congregational direction. 

#### Ministry Context

In conjunction with providing survey responses to Claude AI, we also fed the AI the first two chapters of [Reggie McNeal's](https://reggiemcneal.org/) book 'The Prsent Future: Six Tough Questions for the Church'.  You can read a quick summary of this book [here](https://lifeandleadership.com/book-summaries/mcneal-the-present-future/).  The main reason for providing this type of context to the AI was to enable it to make better sense of where we're at as a congregation and where we might be able to (1) seize certain opportunties and (2) mitigate certain risks.

### Activity & Engagement Analysis

Note on this section:  AI generated responses in this section highlight the tension between 'inwardly-focused' challenges/opportunities vs. 'externally-focused' challenges/opportunities, the latter of which is mostly absent. The responses focus on 'needs of the church', not needs of our community per se.  To be fair, though, the survey questions were not outwardly-focused questions about how to server/minister/transform our community, so the inward nature of the responses make sense in that light.

### A Hypothetical Example

**This section is NOT AI Generated.  It attempts to demonstrate externally-focused, service-oriented, community ministry applied to real-life possibility.**

* People who use laundromats are typically poorer than those that don't.
* People who use laundromats have some time on their hands to have a non-intrusive conversation.
* Offer to pay for people's laundry.  This is not particularly expensive and should provide an opportunity to start some semblance of normal conversation.
* For people who are open to the idea, provide on-the-spot budgeting help for free.  Not only pay for their laundry, but find other ways to help them free-up cash, change spending habits, create a cheaper diet, reduce transportation costs, etc.  These conversations will likely provide insight into what people's real pains and fears are.
* Pray with people before leaving.  Introduce them to K-Love/Air1 apps for positive, encouraging, day-to-day inspiration on their journey (spiritual or otherwise).
* Tell them about Jesus' love for them and the community of believers West Franklin when appropriate.
* Provide appropriate substance abuse (and other) resources where appropriate.
